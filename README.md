# Fix chromium slow startups

## Category

 quick fix for chromium

## Description

 Chromium was having problem on startups. It took 3~5 seconds to launch. 

 In order to fix this, simply run fix_chromium_slow_startups.sh on terminal.

 Note

 This may not apply KDE,LXDE,Xfce. I only tested in gnome on Ubuntu20.04 64bit.

 ~ Caution~ 

 This fix produce another problem. It is about ssh key. You have to type key_phrase(if you set it up) everytime when you try to ssh any server. It is very annoying. Looking for fix now.
